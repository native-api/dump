# dump
`dump()` dump contents of a Python object

Prints all object attributes and their values. Excludes arguments that should be of no interest by default. The output is tailored to be human-readable. Originally designed for IronPython and CodedUI Test objects
(e.g. excludes attributes that yield `NotSupportedException`) but works in CPython, too.

`enum()` dump members of a .NET enum and their values

`cls()` clear the screen and `cmd` console buffer
